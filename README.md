# Google-Satellite-Embeddings-Forest-Fire-Modelling
Forest fire severity modelling using Google Satellite Embeddings (GSE) and Sentinel-2 imagery at 10 m resolution. Random Forest and XGBoost models predict observed dNBR to map burn severity. The project enhances high-resolution fire impact assessment through advanced machine learning and satellite data integration.
